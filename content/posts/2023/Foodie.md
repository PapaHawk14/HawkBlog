My favourite kitchen utensil at the moment is my Ninja Foodie.
I do anything from Wings, Pork ribs, cakes and beef ribs in this thing.
Regardless of the brand (this is not a product review), get on it.

For ideas and recommendations, do an AirFry recipe search on YouTube, and you will get all the inspiration you need.

My Favourite is "prohomecooks"
