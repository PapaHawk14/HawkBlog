## For Cinnamon Rolls:

## For Sticky Buns:

Follow the recipe above through Step 4 and roll out the dough out to 1/4-inch thickness, roll up into a log, and cut into 12 pieces as with the cinnamon roll method. Then combine 1/4 cup soft butter, 1/4 cup packed brown sugar, and 1 tablespoon light corn syrup together and spread the mixture on the bottom of a greased pan. Sprinkle with chopped nuts.
