## Ingredients

-   1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil
-   4 cloves garlic
-   1/2 cup canned tomato sauce
-   1/2 tsp sweet smoked Spanish paprika
-   1 cup round rice - > Bahia, Balilla, Bomba, Senia, and Calasparra
-   2 1/2 cups fish broth
-   1/2 tsp saffron threads
-   12 raw jumbo shrimp peeled & deveined
-   10 fresh mussels
-   sea salt
-   black pepper
-   handful freshly chopped parsley
-   1 lemon

## Method

1. Heat a sauce pan with a high heat, add in 2 1/2 cups of fish broth and pinch in 1/2 tsp of saffron threads

2.  While the broth is heating up, heat a paella pan with a medium-high heat and add in a 1/4 cup of extra virgin olive oil, while the olive oil is heating finely mince 4 cloves garlic, then immediately add the garlics into the pan and mix with the oil, 20 to 30 seconds later add in 1/2 cup of canned tomato sauce, 1/2 tsp sweet smoked Spanish paprika and season with sea salt & black pepper, mix it all together, 1 minute later add in 1 cup of round rice and mix with the tomato sauce, 1 minute later add in the hot saffron infused seafood broth, season with a little sea salt and give it a gentle mix so the rice is evenly divided, after this don´t mix the rice anymore, as it disrupts the way the rice cooks, but you can give the pan a quick shake once in a while

3.  While the paella is cooking, grab 12 raw peeled & deveined shrimp and pat them down with paper towels, then season with sea salt & black pepper, also grab 8 to 10 fresh mussels and clean them under cold running water, remove the beards from each one and scrub off any of the barnacles

4.  About 8 minutes after adding the broth into the pan, add the shrimps seasoned side down and the fresh mussels, 2 minutes later lower the fire to a low-medium heat and simmer for 3 minutes, then heat it back to a medium-high heat for 60 to 90 seconds to achieve the famous socarrat, the layer of burnt rice underneath, then remove the pan from the heat and completely cover with a dish cloth, 3 minutes later uncover the paella, garnish with lemon wedges and sprinkle with some freshly chopped parsley, enjoy!
