## INGREDIENTS

-   1 medium red onion, very thinly sliced
-   ½ cup water
-   ¼ cup distilled white vinegar
-   ¼ cup apple cider vinegar or additional white vinegar
-   1 ½ tablespoons maple syrup or honey
-   1 ½ teaspoons fine sea salt
-   ¼ teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)

## INSTRUCTIONS

1.  Pack the onions into a 1-pint mason jar or similar heat-safe vessel. Place the jar in the sink, to catch any splashes of hot vinegar later.
2.  In a small saucepan, combine the water, both vinegars, maple syrup, salt, and pepper flakes. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over medium heat, then carefully pour the mixture into the jar over the onions.
3.  Use a butter knife or spoon to press the onions down into the vinegar and pop any air bubbles in the jar. Let the pickled onions cool to room temperature (about 20 to 30 minutes), at which point they should be sufficiently pickled for serving.
4.  Cover and refrigerate leftover pickled onions for later. Quick-pickled onions are best consumed within three days, but they keep for 2 to 3 weeks in the refrigerator.

## NOTES

**MAKE IT VEGAN:** Be sure to use maple syrup instead of honey.

**CAN I CAN IT?** No. This recipe is a “refrigerator pickle” recipe. It is _not_ designed for canning in a water bath, and it has not been tested for canning safety. Please do not attempt! Follow a recipe specifically designed for canning instead.
