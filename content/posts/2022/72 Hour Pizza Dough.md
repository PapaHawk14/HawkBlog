This dough is simple and foolproof—but you do need TIME. Not hands on or working time, but time for a 24-hour rising period and then a 48-hour cold ferment. That’s 72 hours total, in case you don’t have a calculator.

The first phase is a 24-hour period of allowing the dough to bulk ferment (or to rise as one unit before being divided into individual dough portions) at room temperature. Just find a spot where you can park the dough where it will not be disturbed. The dough will impart a pleasant aroma will make your kitchen smell like a bakery.

Next, you’ll portion out the dough, ball it up and store the individual portions in the refrigerator for a minimum of 1 day, but up to 10. This is when the dough will develop some kick ass flavor. The process is called cold fermentation, and it slows down the activity of the yeast to produce amazing flavors in your dough. The “strike zone” for the dough, in terms of optimal texture and flavor, is on days 3 through 5 (or, 48-96 hours after the bulk fermentation that occurs in step 4). You can take the dough out of the fridge and make pizza earlier—but the full 72 hour method is what gives it a truly memorable taste and texture.
