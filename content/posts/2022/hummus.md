## Ingredients

-   The Recipe 400 gr canned chickpeas (~14 oz, ~0.9 lb)
-   6 tablespoons tahini
-   1 lemon
-   small splash of cold water
-   2 garlic cloves
-   As much as you need – extra virgin olive oil
-   Half teaspoon salt
-   To garnish: ground sumac ground cumin, 2-3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, Parsley

## Method

**The trick for awesome Hummus is OIL. While blending add oil till its as smooth as you want……**

For a perfectly smooth hummus first you need to peel the chickpeas.

Add 400 gr canned chickpeas in a large bowl and rub to take the skin of.

Fill the bowl with water and skins will start to float. When you drain, skins will group on water and it will be much easier to collect. –

Add peeled chickpeas, 2 cloves of garlic, half of a teaspoon salt, 6 tablespoons of tahini and 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil to food processor.

Squeeze a lemon juice and run for 7-8 minutes on low-medium speed. While the food processor is working the hummus will get warm. To avoid that add 6 cubes of ice gradually. ıce will help to make a smooth hummus as well.

After a couple of minutes hummus will be ok but not smooth enough. Don’t give up and continue until the hummus is creamy. You can run on high speed at this stage.

Taste and adjust the lemon, tahini and salt to your taste. Garlic and olive oil always need time to settle. If you have 2-3 hours before eating the taste will be better.

When the hummus is ready put on serving table and make a little crater with the back of a spoon. Sprinkle ground sumac, cumin and parsley leaves. Last but not least pour 2-3 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil.
