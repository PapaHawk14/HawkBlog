I love Hainanese chicken and rice. This recipe is my quick and tasty version, not perfect, but yummy and quick none the less. **I'm using a Ninja Air Fryer with a pressure cooking feature.**

## INGREDIENTS

1 person??

3.  once cooked remove the liquid and cook 1 cup of rice in the liquid using normal method.
