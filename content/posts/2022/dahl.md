Lovely flavorful dahl that can easily be adapted to a curry sauce. To do so, don't add the lentils, replace with a large can of coconut milk/cream.

## Ingredients

-   2tbsp oil (coconut, sesame) for the pan
-   1 tsp cumin seeds (whole)
-   1 tsp brown (or other) mustard seeds (whole)
-   1 small tomato, chopped as you like
-   1 piece ginger (25mm or a thumb) peeled and minced
-   As much garlic as you need. I use 3-4 cloves.
-   1/2 tsp ground tumeric
-   1 tsp curry powder
-   1-2 tsp chilli powder to taste (optional)
-   1/2 tsp ground corriander
-   1/2 tsp sea salt, add more to taste if you need
-   1/8 tsp freshly ground black pepper
-   1 cup yellow split peas or lentils (I use red)
-   3 1/2 cups water
-   2 cups chopped spinach (optional)
-   juice of 1/2 lime
-   1/4 cup choped corriander leaves (garnish)

## Method

In a dutch oven or large pot, heat the oil over med-high heat. Add the cumin and mustard seeds, and cook for about 1 minute until you hear them begin to pop. (careful not to burn them)

Add the chopped tomato and cook for 1 minute. Add the dry ingredients (ginger, tumeric, curry powder, corriander, salt, pepper). Reduce the heat and cook for a further 1 minute.

Stir in peas or lentils and water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 45 minutes on low until the peas/lentils are soft enough to mash.

Using a spoon or whisk, mash the peas/lentils. Once the daal reaches a smooth consistency (of your liking), optionally, stir in the spinach and cook for a further 5 minutes.

Top with the corriander leaves and lime juice and serve with a side of naan or rice (if desired)
